# New Here
## Description
New Here is a social app for finding group and individual activities
when moving to or visiting a new place. The app allows users to 
create a profile, join events, and create new events. In addition, 
each event has a live chat feed for joiners of an event to 
communicate with each other. Events are location based, so changing
your locations changes the events available to you in that area.
